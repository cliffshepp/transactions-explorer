        <h1>Data collection</h1>
        <p>We collect data from departments every 3 months. Data sets cover a 12 month period so that seasonal variation is balanced out. The latest data published covers April 2012 to March 2013.</p>
        <p>You can <a href="{{ 'data/transaction-volumes.csv' | as_absolute_url }}" title="Download the full data set (CSV)" download="transaction-volumes.csv">download the full raw data set</a> into spreadsheet-compatible CSV files.</p>

        <h1>Transactional services</h1>
        <p>Transactional services are activities like vehicle licensing, passport applications, benefit claims and filing company accounts. They involve an exchange of information, money, licences, goods or services and result in a change in the records held by government organisations.</p>
        <p>Fuller data is given for high-volume services, which have over 750,000 transactions per year, or a departmental spend of over £750m per year. Access this data by clicking on the service names.</p>

        <h1>Some terms explained</h1>
        <p>The data is labelled with these terms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>digital take-up - percentage of transactions completed or partially completed through digital channels</li>
          <li>cost per transaction - average cost of providing each successfully completed transaction across all channels, including web, phone, post and in person</li>
          <li>total cost - overall cost per year of providing a service, including staff, IT and accommodation costs</li>
          <li>data coverage - proportion of requested data provided by each department</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="content-group" name="5">
        <a name="costs"></a>
        <h1>Costs</h1>
        <p>Most services can’t be compared directly, as they include different processes. Cost per transaction isn’t a measure of cost-efficiency across different services. The notes on costs for individual services provide additional information about how cost per transaction has been calculated for each service.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-group" name="6">
        <h3>Cost models</h3>
        <p>‘Fiscal’ indicates transactional services which are paid for directly through departmental budgets. Under the fiscal cost model, savings from improving the efficiency of transactional services will benefit the taxpayer.</p>
        <p>‘Cost recovery’ indicates services which are paid for by service users. Under the cost recovery model, savings will generally benefit consumers, through lower prices or fees.</p>
